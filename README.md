# HabitTracker

A full-stack habit tracker with JWT-based authentication, built with .NET 10 and React.

## About

HabitTracker lets a user register, create habits on a flexible schedule (daily, weekly, specific weekdays, or every other day), mark them done, and see progress over time - current streak, monthly completion rate, and a GitHub-style activity calendar. It was built as a portfolio project to demonstrate a complete, production-shaped slice of full-stack work: a layered .NET backend with a relational schema and EF Core migrations, cookie-free JWT authentication with rotating refresh tokens, and a React + TypeScript frontend where all server state goes through TanStack Query (no ad-hoc `useState` mirrors of API data).

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- .NET 10 / ASP.NET Core Minimal API
- Entity Framework Core 10 + Npgsql (PostgreSQL)
- FluentValidation
- xUnit

**Frontend**
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite
- TanStack Query
- Zustand
- Axios
- React Router

**Deploy**
- Docker (multi-stage build for the API)
- Railway (API + PostgreSQL)
- Vercel (frontend)

## Features

- Email/password registration and login
- JWT access tokens with rotating, revocable refresh tokens (hashed at rest, one-time use)
- Habit CRUD (create, edit, archive, delete), scoped per authenticated user
- Four scheduling modes: daily, weekly, specific weekdays (e.g. Mon/Wed/Fri), or every other day
- Idempotent "mark done" / "unmark" for a specific date
- Per-habit stats: current streak, monthly completion rate, days completed vs. days elapsed
- Activity calendar per habit - click a past day to backfill a missed entry, navigate between months
- Dashboard with streak badges per habit card
- User profile page (email, join date, active habit count)

## Architecture

The backend follows a layered structure so business rules stay independent of EF Core, ASP.NET Core, and each other's implementation details - the `Application` layer only depends on `Domain` and abstractions it defines itself (`IApplicationDbContext`, `ITokenService`, ...), which `Infrastructure` implements. This keeps the core logic (validation, streak/percentage calculation, token issuance rules) unit-testable without a database or an HTTP pipeline.

## Key Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Refresh tokens are hashed (SHA-256) at rest and rotated on every use.** Each refresh call revokes the old token and issues a new pair, and logout revokes the token explicitly. Reuse detection (auto-revoking a whole token family if a already-used token is replayed) is **not** implemented - see Possible Improvements.
- **Access and refresh tokens are stored in `localStorage` on the client**, not `httpOnly` cookies. This is simpler for a single-frontend pet project and avoids CORS/cookie complications from the API (Railway) and frontend (Vercel) living on different domains - but it is more exposed to XSS than an `httpOnly` cookie would be.
- **Stats (streak, monthly completion rate) are computed on every request from raw `HabitCompletion` rows**, not denormalized/cached. Simpler and always correct, at the cost of recomputing on each read - acceptable at pet-project scale.
- **"Today" is the client's local date**, sent explicitly to the API (e.g. `?today=2026-07-02`) rather than derived from the server clock, so streaks make sense in the user's own timezone. The server validates that the date isn't in the future, but there's no server-side timezone awareness beyond that - a user traveling across timezones mid-day could see edge-case behavior.
- **Weekly-frequency habits use a simplified v1 model**: a streak counts consecutive ISO weeks with at least one completion, and the monthly rate is the fraction of the month's elapsed weeks with a completion. It intentionally doesn't try to handle habits with a target count greater than 1 per period.
- **Specific-weekdays and every-other-day habits share one "scheduled day" abstraction** with the daily case: streak and monthly-rate math walk day by day, skip any date that isn't scheduled (it neither counts nor breaks the streak), and give "today" the same one-day grace period daily habits get. "Every other day" always uses a fixed 2-day interval anchored to the habit's creation date - not a configurable interval or a user-chosen anchor. A completion logged on a non-scheduled day (e.g. marking a Mon/Wed/Fri habit done on a Tuesday) is still stored and shown on the calendar, it just doesn't count toward that habit's streak or completion rate.
- **Database migrations run automatically on startup in Production** (`Program.cs`, wrapped in try/catch with logging). This keeps deployment to a single Railway service simple, but it's a known compromise: with more than one instance running concurrently, two instances migrating at once can race. A real multi-instance deployment should run migrations as a separate release step instead.

## Getting Started (local)

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local PostgreSQL)

### 1. Start PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts `postgres:16` on port `5432` with database/user/password all set to `habittracker` (see `docker-compose.yml`).

### 2. Configure the API

Create `src/HabitTracker.Api/appsettings.Development.json` (gitignored - not committed) with:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Postgres": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=habittracker;Username=habittracker;Password=habittracker"
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Issuer": "HabitTracker.Api",
    "Audience": "HabitTracker.Client",
    "Key": "<a random string, at least 32 bytes, base64-encoded works well>",
    "AccessTokenMinutes": 15,
    "RefreshTokenDays": 7
  }
}
```

### 3. Apply migrations and run the API

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef   # if not already installed
dotnet ef database update --project src/HabitTracker.Infrastructure --startup-project src/HabitTracker.Api
dotnet run --project src/HabitTracker.Api
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:5290` (and `https://localhost:7289`) by default - see `src/HabitTracker.Api/Properties/launchSettings.json`. Swagger UI is available at `/swagger` in Development.

### 4. Run the frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to the backend (`vite.config.ts`).

### Frontend

| Variable | Used for | Local | Production (Vercel) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Base URL for API requests | Unset — falls back to `/api` (Vite proxy) | Full API URL, e.g. `https://<railway-domain>/api` |

## API Overview

All routes are prefixed with `/api`. Authenticated routes expect `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`.

| Method | Path | Purpose | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Create an account, returns token pair | No |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Log in, returns token pair | No |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | Exchange a refresh token for a new pair | No |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Revoke a refresh token | Yes |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Current user's profile + habit count | Yes |
| GET | `/habits` | List habits (`?includeArchived=`) | Yes |
| GET | `/habits/{id}` | Get a single habit | Yes |
| POST | `/habits` | Create a habit | Yes |
| PUT | `/habits/{id}` | Update a habit | Yes |
| PUT | `/habits/{id}/archive` | Archive a habit | Yes |
| DELETE | `/habits/{id}` | Delete a habit | Yes |
| GET | `/habits/{id}/stats` | Streak & monthly completion rate (`?today=`) | Yes |
| GET | `/habits/stats` | Stats summary across all active habits | Yes |
| POST | `/habits/{habitId}/complete` | Mark a date done (idempotent) | Yes |
| DELETE | `/habits/{habitId}/complete` | Unmark a date | Yes |
| GET | `/habits/{habitId}/completions` | List completions in a date range | Yes |
| GET | `/health` | Health check | No |

## Testing

```bash
dotnet test tests/HabitTracker.Tests
```

Covers `HabitStatsCalculator` - the pure functions behind streak and monthly-completion-rate math - with 27 unit tests over edge cases: empty completion sets, gaps that break a streak, a missing "today" that doesn't break it, unsorted input, non-scheduled days being skipped without breaking a streak, and dispatch across all four frequency types (daily, weekly, specific weekdays, every other day).

## Possible Improvements

- Refresh-token reuse detection (revoke the full token family if an already-used token is replayed)
- `httpOnly` cookie-based token storage instead of `localStorage`
- Server-side timezone awareness beyond "reject future dates"
- Have the dashboard use the existing `GET /habits/stats` aggregate endpoint instead of one stats request per habit card
- Localization (UI is English-only)
